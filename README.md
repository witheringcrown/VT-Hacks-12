This project was made for the hackathon VTHacks 12 using react for the frontend and python/flask for the backend.

TinDnDr was meant to be essentially a tabletop roleplaying game dating site. Users could create an account and enter parameters of what you were looking for in a group to play with. Users would then be matched with others to exchange contact info and coordinate a group to play with.

Unfortunately, we we unable to finish our project within the given 36-hour time limit as neither of us had used our chosen tools for this project previously. We both tried to use the hackathon as a way to learn a new toolset and in that goal we achieved.

I worked on the front-end systems for this project using react and css. I was able to link the frontend to a third party application called PropelAuth which allowed users to sign up, login, and logout. I then was able to use the frontend to collect data from the user via multiple methods including a dropdown menu, a set of buttons, and a text input.
